## What is Blockolony?

Our mission at Blockolony is to create a resourceful network for anyone interested in the Blockchain space. Whether you are a investor, developer, miner, or just curious about blockchain and cryptocurrencies, please feel free to message our page, get in contact and come along to one of our events to connect with likeminded individuals.

In order for us to gauge interest, it would be really helpful if you could like our page and spread the word with your friends. We are currently based in St. Andrews but hope to be branching out across the UK very soon.

We look forward to seeing you at one of our events in the near future!
